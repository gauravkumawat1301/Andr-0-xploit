#CHANGELOG (V1.0 - V1.1)

#Added
In previous version (V1.0) if a dependency is missing it will try to install it whether internet is connected or not but now a 
new feature is added in script which will first check whether internet is connected or not. 

If you are not connected to internet still you can run the script as there is a option before installing dependencies
whether you want to install dependency or not.
